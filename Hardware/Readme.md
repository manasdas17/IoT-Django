# Building the devices for the IoT-Demo 

This demo uses Wifi devices in the ESP8266 family, in particular the NodeMCU. <br/>
However it uses the Arduino IDE to compile programs rather than the built-in LUA interpreter. 

This guide would be helpful in setting up the Arduino IDE: <br/>

Each device is tagged as Cake.deviceid and the hardware consists of 1 NodeMCU board & 2 pull-up buttons. <br/>
A Serial-LCD might also be helpful in displaying Cake.price, but this isn't being used at the moment.
