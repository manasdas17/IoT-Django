*** Building the devices for the IoT-Demo *** 

This demo uses Wifi devices in the ESP8266 family, in particular the NodeMCU. 
However it uses the Arduino IDE to compile programs rather than the built-in LUA interpreter. 

This guide would be helpful in setting up the Arduino IDE:

Each device is tagged to a Cake as Cake.deviceid and the hardware consists of the NodeMCU board & 2 pull-up buttons. 
A Serial-LCD might also be helpful in displaying Cake.price, but this isn't being used at the moment.
